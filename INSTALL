Compiling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure the Qt (>= 4.6) development libraries are installed:

* In Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev zlib1g-dev`
* In Fedora:        `yum install qt-devel`
* In Arch Linux:    `pacman -S qt`
* In Mac OS X with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/): `brew install qt`

Now you can compile by running:

    $ qmake (or qmake-qt4 on some systems, like Fedora)
    $ make

To do a shadow build, you can run qmake from a different directory and refer
it to KAuth.pro, for example:

    $ cd build
    $ qmake ../KAuth.pro
    $ make

You can now simply run Tiled using bin/tiled.

Installing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For installing Tiled you can run `make install`. By default Tiled will install
to `/usr/local`. You can change this prefix when running qmake, and/or you can
change the install root when running make install, as follows:

Use `/usr` instead of `/usr/local`:

    $ qmake -r PREFIX=/usr

(Recursive needed when it's not the first time that you're running qmake, since
this affects nested pro files)

Install to some packaging directory:

    $ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/tmp/tiled-pkg

By default, Tiled and its plugins are compiled with an Rpath so that they can
find the shared libtiled library when running it straight after compile. When
packaging for a distribution, this Rpath should generally be disabled by
appending `RPATH=no` to the qmake command.
